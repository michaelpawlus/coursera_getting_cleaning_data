Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The run_analysis.R script does the following actions:

  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The result of running the script is a combined data set showing only mean and standard deviation values written to a file named tidy_data.txt
